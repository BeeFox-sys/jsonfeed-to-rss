			<description>My test XML-RPC server is up at betty.scripting.com. Same calling conventions as the original betty.&lt;i&gt;userland&lt;/i&gt;.com (which is not up at the moment). The idea is to test this server, verify interop, or fix it, iterate, and when it's solid, make this the definitive test server. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/client/code.js&quot;&gt;example code&lt;/a&gt; in JavaScript that calls this server, but any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=betty.userland.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for betty.userland.com should work. More tomorrow.</description>

			<description>Joi Ito &lt;a href=&quot;https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2018/05/28/citing-blogs.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+joi-ito/weblog+(Joi+Ito%27s+Weblog&quot;&gt;makes&lt;/a&gt; the case for citing blogs in academic writing. It doesn’t seem controversial to me. Blogs are where sources write. Same reason journalists cite blogs (and tweets). The record is where it is. For example, I’ve spent the last week rebuilding XML-RPC in JavaScript. The original work was done in 1998, and the process was started with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. That post is very much part of the record. Conclusion -- as with journalism, it's a case of apples and oranges. I've never written an academic paper, and don't expect to. But if you were doing research on networking protocols, the source material for at least some of your work, would be on blogs. Which of course, makes it clear why we should be doing more to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6911j0j3&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;preserve&lt;/a&gt; the record.</description>

			<description>Everyone knows the developing paywall system is unworkable. Eventually there will be distributors between readers and news orgs. If the news world doesn’t work together all their revenue will flow thru tech companies. Not good for business or speech.</description>

			<description>Getting close with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; client and server for Node. You can hook the server up to anything, easily. Factoring is good. Also a client that runs in browser. It’s like getting a classic car running. This is how I have fun.</description>

			<title>Debugging Node apps</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/81#issuecomment-391938121&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; to yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/24.html#a145021&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; about getting at the data in a Node app using the debugger. There's a new way to do it. First you have to install a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nodejs-v8-inspector-manag/gnhhdgbaldcilmgcpfddgdbkhjohddkj&quot;&gt;Chrome app&lt;/a&gt;. Then launch the Node app with a --inspect flag.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;node --inspect test.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The app launches. It displays a URL to open in Chrome. Copy it, paste it into the browser address bar, and the debugger opens. Your files are in the left margin. Click one. Set a breakpoint. When the app stops there you'll see the data in the right panel, and when you click the wedge, it expands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One concern, this process requires using Chrome, and I'm expecting to have to stop using it soon because it &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;breaks&lt;/a&gt; all my sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Listen. If you have something worth saying that requires more than a single tweet, as a reader I will feel more respected if you write it in a blog post, and refine it so it's easy to figure out what your point is. There still is a cacaphony of people wanting attention, more all the time, and it might be that more people will see your tweets, but I think more people will comprehend your thinking if you write it, as opposed to tweeting it. There is a difference. (Also I'm more inclined to route a blog post through my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt;. I rarely circulate tweets that way.)</description>

			<title>What's normal is what's real</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Josh Marshall wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/stop-talking-about-norms&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; yesterday saying it's time for journalism to stop talking about norms. Of course I agree. I've been writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/23.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/21.html&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; a lot lately.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an analogy. Suppose you have a horrible accident and one of your legs is amputated. So you're trying to learn how to live with a single leg. All the while you're screaming at anyone who will listen: This is not normal. This is not normal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; normal. It just isn't what was normal in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a word for reporters who behave as if The Trump Totalitarian State, the one that's still emerging, isn't normal. Deluded. Not coping with reality. There are proper ways to respond to a totalitarian state, but saying &lt;i&gt;it's not normal&lt;/i&gt; is not a good response.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're in a weird period where (following the analogy) the leg hasn't been fully amputated yet. For example we still have a court system that's willing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/judge-orders-donald-trump-to-stop-blocking-people-on-twitter/&quot;&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; the president to stop blocking people on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An aside, how will that be implemented? Will Twitter disable the block command on his account? Will they unblock all the people he's previously blocked? Surely they're not depending on El Presidentè to personally obey the order? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We still appear to have free speech. The right to assemble. Our votes still seem to work, even though some our votes are suppressed. But there's no question the doctor intends to amputate. So maybe we should be talking about things other than the incorrect idea that this is not normal. It most definitely is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What if, instead of only studying the way Trump is crashing our democracy, we devoted equal time to studying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry_in_the_Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others&quot;&gt;totalitarian&lt;/a&gt; state, so we can anticipate what's coming next. We still have a long way to go before the Constitution is gone, so the more we know about what's coming next, the more effective we can be at heading it off.

			<title>The oligarchs must know climate change is real</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I always figured that our oligarchs know full well that climate change is real, they just have a different strategy for dealing with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/05/happy-21st-century.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Stross yesterday where he outlined what I assumed was their actual plan. Here's the relevant section.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Right now climate denialism is a touchstone of the American right, but the evidence is almost impossible to argue against right now and it's increasingly obvious that many of the people who espouse disbelief are faking it—virtue signalling on the hard right. Sooner or later they'll flip. When they do so, they will inevitably come to the sincere, deeply held belief that culling the bottom 50% to 90% of the planetary population will give them a shot at survival in the post-greenhouse world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have told this story myself, once at full volume in a crowded NYC subway car (inadvertently, I tend to speak loudly) and was rewarded with agreement from fellow subway riders. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Idea processing. In your brain a complex project in all its facets is just there. To implement the project, you must serialize it and communicate it, so that the same blob appears in the individual minds of the team. If they understand how their work relates to others, it triggers their instinctive sense of teamwork. We’re a social species, we’re more functional if we understand where we fit in. This is why software that lets you visualize, organize, and communicate your understanding of a project makes you a more effective leader.</description>

			<description>There's a disconnect in developerland. Thinking about the cost of a change, the advocate only contemplates how much it costs for new development, not the cost to transition existing applications, or in the case of the web, websites or domains. The longer the technology has been deployed, the larger the cost, and the more widely deployed the larger the cost. HTTP, the protocol of the web, has been constant for 25 years, and is probably the most widely deployed protocol in existence. The cost to do a major transformation of HTTP is huge. Yet when we discuss it, advocates generally speak in terms of how much it would cost to put up a new website.</description>

			<description>Sometimes the advocates are aware that there is an installed base. They give it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system&quot;&gt;disparaging name&lt;/a&gt; that makes it seem okay to ignore it. Or they say that the new protocol will be so much better that any sane person will want to switch right away. Or the new protocol is so compelling the installed base will swamp the base of the old klunky one. What happens is the new way is over-done and too complex and gets very slow adoption even from new applications. And if the proponent is a bigco, like Apple or Google, the market ends up with a hairball. Too many hairballs and the market fades away. Never actually disappears, but people lose interest. (This is what happened with SOAP and all the WS-xxx protocols.)</description>

We're considered spectators, part of a wave that might or might not exist. The only way out of this for the people to organize.

			<description>I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; app that's developing into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;-like thing, but there are still many things Frontier does better or easier. Then I had a flash, why not call Frontier from the Electron app. How? Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; of course. So I wrote an XML-RPC client in JavaScript. Doesn't yet support all the types. It works!

			<description>We're cleaning out the family home before selling it. My mom had a picture of me from the 1980s on the fireplace mantle. It's a publicity shot from Living Videotext that appeared in a fair number of press stories about our company. A good picture, but it had a lot of exposure to the sun over the years. That's what the white spots are from. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>We need to be organized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Once you give up on the idea that the solution to our problems will ever show up in the news, it leads to new observations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like this. The opposition, basically American &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy&quot;&gt;oligarchs&lt;/a&gt;, who thanks to Citizens United have been able to buy enough of the government to dismantle our democracy, is somewhat organized. The rest of us, who, combined, have huge economic power if we could just organize ourselves, are without leadership. Waiting for something unspecified to happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best the Democrats can do is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Perez&quot;&gt;Tom Perez&lt;/a&gt;. He has zero charisma, no ideas, not even slightly bold. I listen to him, but it's painful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our problem isn't knowing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/08/194430.html&quot;&gt;what we stand for&lt;/a&gt;, we know. We need to organize our power to balance that of the oligarchs. The fact that we can't get organized is not an accident. The owners of the media are oligarchs too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Start by looking to people who have done amazing jobs of organizing in the past. I would start with civil rights leaders. Union leaders. The Parkland kids. Teachers. Find people who can speak and write passionately. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not enough to win elections, we have to elect powerful leadership to oppose the already organized and powerful leadership on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Mysterious AWS problem</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Important: This is not a request for support from Amazon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had an issue on one of my EC2 servers starting last night. A few of the apps running on it were not accessible over the net.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I figured one of my code updates had broken something, but I couldn't find a common thread between the apps. They were &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://rss.art19.com/the-daily&quot;&gt;xmlviewer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://river5.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://json.chat/&quot;&gt;jsonchat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;xmlviewer is the simplest so I started with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ran it locally. Works fine. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Checked if the request was making it to the server. It wasn't. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Checked if DNS was properly mapped. It was. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I checked if the port was open in the EC2 firewall. It wasn't. There was the problem. I opened the three ports for the three apps and voila, they are working again.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which leaves me with a mystery. I can't imagine I woke up in the middle of the night, in a dream, opened the EC2 console and deleted the entries for the three ports. But they weren't there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What happened? I may never know! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I noticed this feature on &lt;a href=&quot;https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/aaron-schlossberg-is-our-duke-of-the-week&quot;&gt;TPM&lt;/a&gt;, a little control that increases and decreases the text size. I &lt;i&gt;reallllly&lt;/i&gt; appreciate this, even though their story text is already quite readable. I decided to add it to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html&quot;&gt;story pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/19.html&quot;&gt;day archive&lt;/a&gt; pages. A nice little addition. Doesn't clutter things up, and its purpose is fairly obvious, I hope. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Fiddling while earth burns</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to Trieste to speak at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sotn.it/&quot;&gt;State of the Net&lt;/a&gt; conference on June 15. My second time.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate the opportunity, going to Italy in June is nice. Great food, wine and spirited discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about breaking down the walls of journalism to get the people involved. I believe that's still where we're going, and the urgency is all the more severe given the way journalism has been shrinking and drifting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalism got us Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the press were more of the people we'd have had a chance to have a serious talk among ourselves and ask if we really want to go this route. The core problem is the lack of respect we, the people, have for each other, and the extent to which we let politics and journalism herd us. They do it so well, optimized to make us succumb to advertisements, same as the giants of tech. And get us to accept, even desire!, inadequate health care and education, or even safe water and disaster relief. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the climate keeps warming, and the earth becomes less habitable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Side-stepping Google</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Gilmore&quot;&gt;John Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For the latest on Google's plans to turn the open web into Disneyland, read their May 17 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2018/05/evolving-chromes-security-indicators.html&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;. I've written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;backgrounder&lt;/a&gt; on the issue of Google and HTTP. Before jumping to any conclusions about what I think, please read it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/80&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; that there might be a route-around. Suppose there was a site that was a container for the web. It has an address bar at the top where you enter the address of a site. It then displays the contents of the site below. It accepts HTTP or HTTPS. But the container site is accessible via HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Problem solved? It seems we've restored access to the sites Google doesn't like. Yes you have to access us in a compatibility box, and that's hopefully just a temporary fix until one of Google's competitors decides to try a more cooperative approach to whatever it is Google is trying to do (and I don't believe it has anything to do with our security, it's their ad revenue they're worried about).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/80&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment on the &lt;i&gt;technical&lt;/i&gt; merits of this idea.

			<title>About the angry lawyer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a lightly edited version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/997152468084641792&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; I posted earlier. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My grandparents, all citizens of the US, and taxpayers, spoke English and their native languages. My paternal grandparents spoke Russian. On my mother's side, they spoke German, Polish, Yiddish, probably some Russian too. To get by they had to speak lots of languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://forward.com/fast-forward/401320/pro-trump-jewish-lawyer-caught-ranting-spanish-new-york-deli/&quot;&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; who got so angry has a Jewish last name, and if he's like a lot of second or third generation Jews in the US, has recent ancestors, that he may have known, who spoke English with an accent and it wasn't their only language.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I bet he was embarrassed by his grandparents. I know I was. And now, as an adult, I regret this. They had hard lives. They got swept up in the Holocaust. That fucked up our family in many ways. And I bet the lawyer got some of that too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So even though we got screwed, we lived. That's huge. I wouldn't exist if it weren't for their perseverance and courage. Determination. That's why the immigrants who actually make it here are such intelligent and capable people. They had to be, or they wouldn't have made it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As always people focus on the number of people killed. Six million. But many more people survived, but were damaged by the experience. We live with them. We are them. And that's just us. What about African-Americans. They rose from slavery! Can you imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another idea for a new social media app/feature. A club of peers, people with the same number of followers, a similar kind of following, similar background, similar influence with others. Let an algorithm decide all this. Say 40 peers per group. You get one coupon for each, and with that coupon you can send a message to an individual. It's labeled as such. The one shot you have to influence another person. No second chances, no discussion, just a simple pitch. You can use as much text as you like, but beware the recipient is under no obligation to read any of it. You can use links, simple styling, paragraphs.</description>

			<title>NBA playoff report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the NBA because without much effort anyone can see what's going on. It's a very accessible sport. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And this time of year, the second-to-last round of the playoffs, is when it gets most dramatic. The teams with the most to lose are in a contest where all but one will lose. The trick is to figure out who, and why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then there's hope. Who do you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to win? For me it's totally predictable, unless the Knicks are involved, I always root for the talented underdog. The one everyone assumes will not win. Especially if earlier I thought myself that they would not win. Right now that team is, of course, the Celtics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like them because like the Warriors, they can win in a variety of ways, where the other two teams, the Rockets and the Cavs have basically one way to win, an isolation play with a star player who can drive to the basket and also has a good jump shot. The Rockets have two of these guys, James Harden and Chris Paul, and the Cavs have LeBron James. It's easy to defend against a team with one or two ways to win, just concentrate the defense on the strong player, and force the ball to come out through one of the others. Last night at first James looked like he might carry the Cavs, but it turns out he is human, he clearly got tired and hurt as the game went on. The shots that were going down like daggers in the first quarter were missing the mark in the third and fourth. HIs defense was porous. For the last two nights, against the Celtics, he couldn't carry the team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Celtics on the other hand, move the ball around on offense until they find a play. This means you can't double-team anyone, everyone is a threat. You really can't defend against that. They're pretty much always going to get off a shot. And people get to rest, so they don't play exhausted as LeBron was.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course the Warriors are even better at the distributed multi-threat offense than the Celtics, but they're also worn out by so much winning. Their tiredness comes from boredom. Who cares if they win another championship. I imagine even Bay Area fans are looking for something more interesting and less predictable to watch. The players still have to show up. But they can't be even slightly hungry for a win. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand this Celtics team has everything to prove. Not only are they very young, they are playing without their two biggest stars who are injured. You have to wonder, no matter what the outcome this year, what they're going to be like next year if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward&quot;&gt;Gordon Hayward&lt;/a&gt; are healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I'm hoping for Celtics vs Golden State in the finals. That could be an epic contest. Multiple threats, who knows where the ball is going to go at any moment, and a sharp contrast in perspective, youth vs royalty.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Another little feature for this blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Previously I could put numbers in front of items in a list by adding an a flNuberedSubs attribute on the parent with the value true. Like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Two&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Three&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, when I was digging around in Old School to add collapsible headlines, I realized I could easily add bulleted items, for when numbers aren't right. The attribute is flBulletedSubs. Here's a demo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is a bulleted item.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As is this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And so is this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's see if it works! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yes, it does.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A refinement of the new feature</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Liudvikas Bukys, in a comment &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=discuss&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that items with flNumberedSubs set true be rendered as ordered lists in the RSS feed. Good idea. It was pretty easy to implement. If it works, this list should appear in your RSS reader as a numbered list, not a bulleted list.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;George Washington&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;John Adams&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;James Madison&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;James Monroe&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Andrew Jackson&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Martin Van Buren&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And to be sure that bulleted lists still work...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;New Jersey&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Florida&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mississippi&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/05/16/feedlyScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what this post looks like in Feedly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
